## Requirements
### C# Tasks
Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
Each C# task requires its own folder and .sln file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples
All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
### C# Tests
Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
All tests should be inside a separate folder and named as specified in each task
All your test files will be executed using dotnet test
We strongly encourage you to work together on tests so that you don’t miss any edge case
