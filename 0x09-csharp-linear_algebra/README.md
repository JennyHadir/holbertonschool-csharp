### Requirement
#### .txt Answers
All your files should end with a new line
If the answer ends in a decimal, round it to the nearest hundredth
Vectors and matrices should be formatted with parentheses and commas as shown below:
Vector:

(0, 0.03)
Matrix:

(1, 0, -7.64)
(-9.41, -0.23, 7)
#### C# Projects
Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your GitHub and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
In the following tasks, there are no main files. For each C# task, you can use the variables in the related task prior to it to create your own main files for testing
All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
You are not allowed to use the Vector or Matrix classes in this project
You can use the Math class in this project
If the taskâ€™s return value can end in a decimal, round it to the nearest hundredth
