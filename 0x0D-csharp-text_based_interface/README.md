# 0x0D. C# - Text-based Interface

In this project, we’ll be using all of the collective Foundations and C# skills you’ve gained to create a console application that allows a user to manage inventories of items.

* Data will be stored in JSON format
* Users must be able to create, read, update, and delete objects
* The class and attribute names used in this application will be generic, making it versatile for different use cases and easily extended  
This project is more flexible than previous console application projects. The checker will not be looking for specific output; instead, the majority of your application will be manually reviewed. This means that you will not be given specifics on exactly how things should be printed or how input is taken. This reflects how you may need to approach projects as a software engineer in the industry. You won’t always be given specifications to follow to the letter – you’ll need to be able to make your own informed, logical decisions about an application’s functionality. Some key things you should consider when creating the console application:

* How should the application take properties for a new or updated object? Should it be done in one line? Or should there be a secondary prompt after their initial create/update command? How else can this be implemented?
* What’s a readable way to display an object in the terminal?
Should there be a confirmation prompt for deleting objects?
* What commands require error messages? What should an error message contain in order to be useful?
* What should be done to make your Github repo informative and useful for other contributors and users of this application?
